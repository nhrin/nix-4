Example using my custom lib for reverse string. Lib can:

1. Simple reverse - takes your string, split it with spaces, reverses each word;
2. Reverse for substring - takes your string and part of string, that you need reverse;
3. Reverse for indexes - takes your string and two integers, reverses each word(or part of the word) between indexes;

For start use file "start.bat"
