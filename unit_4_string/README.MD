Example using my custom lib for reverse string.
Lib can:

    1. Simple reverse - takes your string, split it with spaces, reverses each word;
    2. Reverse for indexes - takes your string and two integers, reverses each word(or part of the word) between indexes;
    3. Reverse for indexes - takes your string and part of string, that you need reverse;
    
Use method "reverse" only.
