Module 2

App has console interface. Enter numbers for choose logic, follow the prompts.

Task 1 - Dates format:

You may choose 2 variant: use default list or enter dates manually.

Task 2 - Algorithm complexity:

App use file "names.txt" for input data. You may change it.
Logic of searching: app use only one looping through, so algorithm complexity = O(n).

Task 3 - Minimal cost

Use file "input.txt" according to the conditions of the problem. For determining minimal cost specify cities in the order of insertion and not otherwise.
For example you file:
4
gdansk
2
2 1
3 3
bydgoszcz
3
1 1
3 1
torun
3
1 3
2 1
if you want know minimal cost bitween torun and gdansk please write "gdansk torun",
NOT ENTER FOR DETERMINING "torun gdansk", becouse result will be incorrect.

For start use file "start.bat"
